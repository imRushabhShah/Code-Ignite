# Code-Ignite

In a coders life when we see an error we tend to detect the error and search for the error from the StackOverflow.
We Integrated the UiPath RPA with Eclipse editor and trained it to detect the most probable error and scrape for the error and return top results from our most reliable source StackOverflow.

The code sonsists of 
1. flask server files 
2. UiPaths RPA files

The additional model we have added to the project is keeping logs of type of errors we receive and in future we can use it to keep cache of it to save time from scraping form internet.
